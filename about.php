				<center><p style="font-size: 18px"> StudentsLifeLine is a great way for students from all phases of life to put out their questions to the world without any hesitations.

				<center><p style="font-size: 18px"> This Forum is built especially keeping in mind the college students. It provides a platform for students to create forums online to discuss various topics that they have in their mind. We are able to achieve this by helping students remain anonymous during posting threads. As a result of this, even the most cliché’s of question, which maybe not so cliché for many other students, are answered without the particular student revealing his/her identity. Furthermore, many noticeboard entities can also be uploaded on this website to help keep a tabs of all the events going around the campus. We aimed to make to a system which can be a “helpline” for all students who are in need. </p></center>
